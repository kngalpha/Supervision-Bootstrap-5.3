    <!-- 5. Center the navbar links using Bootstrap utility classes. -->
    <!-- 6. Create a hero section of your choice. -->
    <!-- 7. The hero section should contain two columns. -->
    <!-- 8. The left column should include a heading, a paragraph, and a button. -->
    <!-- 9. The right column should display an image. -->
    <!-- 10. Develop a services section using the Bootstrap grid system. -->
